        amazing experience here. I signed up for the free intro course and found
        it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter. The next 12 weeks was
        the best - and most grueling - time of my life. Since completing the
        course, I‚Äôve successfully switched careers, working as a Software

        Such a life-changing experience. Highly recommended!

        ‚Äú Before joining the bootcamp, I‚Äôve never written a line of code. I
        needed some structure from professionals who can help me learn
        programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a former student
        of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the program. The
        entire curriculum and staff did not disappoint. They were very hands-on
        and I never had to wait long for assistance. The agile team project, in
        particular, was outstanding. It took my learning to the next level in a
        way that no tutorial could ever have. In fact, I‚Äôve often referred to it
        during interviews as an example of my developent experience. It
        certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack developer after receiving
        multiple offers. 100% recommend! ‚Äù
